Project Overview:

As part of my role as a Data Analyst at Accenture, I led a comprehensive analysis for Social Buzz, a leading social media and content creation platform with over 500 million active users monthly. The project aimed to optimize their content strategy, prepare for an IPO, and manage their extensive data effectively.

Key Responsibilities:

In this project, I utilized SQL to extract and merge sample data sets, which were then loaded into Accenture's sandbox database for analysis. I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and trend analysis to identify key content categories and engagement metrics. Additionally, I participated in an on-site data center audit to evaluate current data practices and created a big data best practices presentation along with IPO guidance documents. My role also involved conducting stress tests and technology architecture workshops to identify and address weak spots in Social Buzzâ€™s technology infrastructure. Throughout the project, I engaged in virtual sessions to present previous client success stories and communicated with previous IPO companies for reference stories.

Key Questions for the Analysis:

What are the top 5 content categories by engagement?

How many unique content categories are there?

Which category receives the most reactions?

What is the month with the highest number of posts?

What is the most popular content type?

How can Social Buzz optimize their content strategy based on these findings?

What factors contributed to the spike in posts during May?

What are the best practices for managing large-scale data effectively?

How can Social Buzz prepare for a successful IPO with their current data practices?

What strategies can be developed for underperforming content categories?

Key Findings:

Top 5 content categories: Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food.

16 unique content categories identified.

Animals category had the most reactions.

May was the month with the highest number of posts.

Photos were the most popular content type.

Insights and Recommendations:

Focus on top-performing categories like Animals and Science to drive engagement.

Prioritize photo content and replicate successful content trends from May.

Explore strategies for less popular categories to find new growth opportunities.

Outcome:
The project provided Social Buzz with actionable insights and strategic recommendations to enhance their content strategy, improve user engagement, and effectively prepare for their upcoming IPO.
